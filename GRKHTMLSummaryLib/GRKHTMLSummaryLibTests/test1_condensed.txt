If you haven't seen it yet, you really should check out &quot;Ninjai&mdash;The Little Ninja&quot; Seriously. It's cool: There's a little Ninja. And a little bird. You still here? Still? Simply visit www.ninjai.com. Can't wait for the feature film? Me either. You should back the Kickstarter when it comes out. And, in the meanwhile you can re-watch all the great originals. "Hello little bird."
